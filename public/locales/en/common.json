    "q14": "How can I find the exact address of my hotel?",
    "q14p1": "After searching on the main page of the Safaraneh website, when you enter the hotel page, the exact address of the hotel is listed at the very beginning of the page. If you need a map, you can select the 'Show Hotel on Map' option at the top right of the page where the hotel pictures are located, and see the exact location.",
    "q15": "How do I choose the view or floor of my room?",
    "q15p1": "If the rooms of a hotel have different views (for example, sea and street), the view of each room is exactly mentioned in its name. You can book a room with the view you want. As for the floor, some hotels have divided their rooms into different floors and have different prices for each of them, from which you can choose the class range you want.",
    "q15q2": "But in some hotels, despite having rooms on different floors or different views, the hotel does not differentiate the price of the rooms and offers them all under a specific title. In this case, you can state your preference in the last step of your reservation in the description section, or contact our experts in Safaraneh and announce which class or perspective you are considering. In this case, our experts will notify the hotel of the request, but keep in mind that there is no guarantee that such requests will be finalized by the agency and that the agency has no obligation for requests outside the divisions submitted by the hotel.",
    "q16": "What are the benefits of online hotel reservation from Safraneh site?",
    "q16p1": "At Safaraneh, we guarantee that you can book hotels in Iran at the lowest price. The lowest price guarantee means that if you see a lower price than what is registered on the travel site, you can contact our experts and let us know.",
